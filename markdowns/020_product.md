## Product Overview

Traditionally, customer inquiries through ServiceNow’s digital channels were assigned using theAdvanced Work Assignment (AWA) engine within the Configurable Agent Workspace, while voice calls handled by Genesys Cloud were routed separately via its embedded CTI (openframe) within ServiceNow’s Agent Workspace. This fragmented approach resulted in disjointed routing, inconsistent agent experiences, and increased administrative complexity.

**Key challenges included**:
- **Siloed Routing & Orchestration** – Voice interactions were managed in Genesys Cloud, while digital interactions were handled in ServiceNow, requiring separate skills, queues, and routing policies across both systems.
- **Operational Overhead for Administrators** – Maintaining agent configurations (skills, queues, and presence states) across two platforms increased workload and complexity.
- **Inconsistent Agent Experience** – Different workflows for digital and voice channels resulted in inefficiencies, a steeper learning curve, and longer handling times.
- **Limited Visibility for Supervisors** – Interaction data was fragmented, making it difficult to analyze performance and optimize customer service strategies.

### The Unified Experience Solution
The Unified Experience from Genesys and ServiceNow resolves these inefficiencies by integrating ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) with Genesys Cloud’s AI-driven orchestration engine, enabling seamless routing, intelligent workload distribution, and a unified agent experience across all channels.

With this expanded framework:
- **Genesys Cloud centralizes routing for all channels** – Digital (chats, cases) and voice interactions are orchestrated in one place, ensuring consistency in customer experience and optimizing cross-channel aware routing.
- **ServiceNow digital interactions (chats, cases)** - can be routed through Genesys Cloud, allowing for intelligent, skills-based distribution alongside voice calls.
- **Agents continue to work exclusively within the ServiceNow Agent Workspace** - This provides a seamless, unified interface for handling both digital and voice interactions.

## Key Capabilities 
- **Consolidated Routing** – Genesys Cloud acts as the single routing engine for all interactions (voice and digital).
- **ServiceNow Case & Chat Routing** – ServiceNow’s native digital interactions are routed through Genesys Cloud, enabling consistent service delivery.
- **Unified Agent Workspace** – The ServiceNow front-office agent workspace remains the primary interface, eliminating application switching.
- **Automated Synchronization** – Presence states are synced automatically between ServiceNow and Genesys Cloud.

## Key Business Value 
- **Improved CSAT** – Customers experience faster, more efficient service with unified routing and orchestration. 
- **Increased Agent Utilization** – Intelligent workload distribution ensures agents are optimally assigned work across all channels. 
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead** – Automated syncing of configurations significantly decreases manual effort. 
- **Lower Agent Attrition** – A seamless workspace and improved efficiency lead to higher job satisfaction and retention. 
- **Reduced Average Handle Time (AHT)** – Fewer application switches, better workflow automation, and AI-powered optimizations lead to faster resolutions. 

By consolidating routing, streamlining operations, and delivering a seamless agent and customer experience, the Unified Experience transforms how organizations orchestrate and manage customer interactions across voice and digital channels.
